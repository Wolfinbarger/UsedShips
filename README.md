# ðŸ“š Blork's Used Spaceship Emporium

A spaceship rental system that allows you to book a ship for a set amount of days of your choosing. Rental charge is then calculated by said amount of days and basic rate of the ship to rent out per day. You can then see which ships you have booked and for what time period. Also can see any of your ships rented out.
